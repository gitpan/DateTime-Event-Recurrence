TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Event::Recurrence

* count hours backwards, in order to avoid DST changes
  which usually occur in the first hours of the day

* new units:

  weekly_year  => first day of first week of year, such that
                  we can get week #34 by adding 33 weeks!

* datetime matrix implementation

  - sort each unit ?

  - iterate using binary search
